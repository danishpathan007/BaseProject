# BaseProject

> We have BaseProject which is easy to use, clone or download project. The only thing to change is the rename of project. 

> In this project We have simple APIManager which is easy to use, upgrade or implement. The only thing to change is the implementation of EndpointItem class. Also, remember because our APIManger is singleton you should inject it in a class when using it.
